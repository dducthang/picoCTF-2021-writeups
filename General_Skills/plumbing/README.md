## Solution 
1. After connecting to the remote system given in the description, I got a lot of lines of string 
and I think I can find out the flag grinding all of that lines. But that was not I gonna do. Using "grep" is much 
better
command: nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 4427 | grep picoCTF

## Flag 
picoCTF{digital_plumb3r_5ea1fbd7}
