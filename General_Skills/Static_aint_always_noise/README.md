## Solution 
1. Get the static and BASH script which are followed the desription 
2. I try to see what inside that "static" file using "cat" conjunct "|" to check if there some thing like "picoCTF....." but it didn't work
3. I try another way using strings "instead" of "cat" then the flag came up

## Flag 
picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_ae0b3ef2}
